The load capability describes the weakest point of this track within this section of line (which is normally a bridge or other sub-track structure). It is expressed as a combination of the line category and speed permitted for trains exerting loads defined for this line category. The result of the classification process is set out in EN 15528:2021 (Annex A) and referred to in that standard as “Line Category”. 

It represents the ability of the infrastructure to withstand the vertical loads imposed by vehicles on the track for regular service as a combination of Line Category with a permitted speed according to EN 15528:2021

More than one combination may be published for the same track if applicable, but it has to be done by repetition of the parameter with one value selected only – that is why ‘Y’ is given in line ‘Can be repeated’

This value will be available until the centre point of the end OP. If gradient has only one value along the track, then only [+/-NN.N] is required.

Gradient is expressed in mm/m; location is expressed in km of the line.

Positive gradient (uphill) is marked with ‘+’ and negative gradient (downhill) is marked by ‘-‘.

The order in the sequence shall be determined by the normal running direction on the specific track. If it is ‘B’ (see 1.1.1.0.0.2) then sequence shall follow the increasing kilometres of the line.

Changes in gradient shall be registered only as far as necessary for train running calculations (minimum length of constant gradient shall be 500 m, the minimum change of gradient value shall be 0,5 mm/m).

The required precision for gradient value is 0,5 mm/m, the required precision of location of the points of change of gradient is 10 m. The points of change of gradient are the points of vertical intersection of each vertical curve."""@en ;

Nominal and severe conditions are defined at TSI Loc&Pas level, section 4.2.6.1.2, which requires that the applicant declares to which snow conditions a vehicle complies with : either “nominal” or “severe” conditions. This technical aspect is reflected in the parameter 4.3.3 “Snow, ice and hail conditions” of ERATV , which will provide the two possible values:
- Nominal conditions correspond to compliance with clause 4.7 of EN 50125 as referred in the §4.2.6.1.2 (1) of TSI Loc&Pas.
To be noted: It is not required to precise the categorisation S1, S2 or S3 as mentioned in the EN 50125.

- Severe conditions correspond to compliance with §4.2.6.1.2 (3) and (4) : the applicant designs and tests its vehicle according to the different scenarios mentioned in the TSI §4.2.6.1.2 (3) (snowdrift, powder snow, temperature gradient, etc.) and set the related provisions to achieve this as required by §4.2.6.1.2 (4) (obstacle deflector of sufficient size, effect of ice and snow on running gear and brake function, etc.)."""@en ;

Geometry is the root class of the hierarchy.
The instantiable subclasses of Geometry are restricted to 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometric objects that exist in 2, 3 or 4-dimensional coordinate space (R2, R3 or R4). Geometry values in R2 have points with coordinate values for x and y. Geometry values in R3 have points with coordinate values for x, y and z or for x, y and m. Geometry values in R4 have points with coordinate values for x, y, z and m.
The interpretation of the coordinates is subject to the coordinate reference systems associated to the point. All coordinates within a geometry object should be in the same coordinate reference systems. Each coordinate shall be unambiguously associated to a coordinate reference system either directly or through its containing geometry. The z coordinate of a point is typically, but not necessarily, represents altitude or elevation. The m coordinate represents a measurement.
All Geometry classes described in this specification are defined so that instances of Geometry are topologically closed, i.e. all represented geometries include their boundary as point sets.

A Point is a 0-dimensional geometric object and represents a single location in coordinate space. 
A Point has an x-coordinate value, a y-coordinate value. If called for by the associated Spatial Reference System, it may also have coordinate values for z and m.
