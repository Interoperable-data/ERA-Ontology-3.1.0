Cooperation with neighbouring countries:
In the meantime Member States concerned, in particular at the request of the railway undertakings, shall perform an assessment with a view to accept the use of 2 reflective plates in one or more sections of their network if the result of the assessment is positive and define appropriate conditions, which shall be based upon an assessment of the risks and operational requirements. This assessment shall be completed within a maximum period of 6 months after receiving the railway undertaking's request. The acceptance of reflective plates shall be granted, unless the Member State can duly justify the refusal based on the negative result of the assessment.
Member States shall in particular endeavour to permit the use of reflective plates on rail freight corridors, with a view to prioritise the current bottlenecks. These sections and details of any conditions pertaining to them shall be recorded in the RINF. Until the information is encoded in RINF, the infrastructure manager shall ensure the information is communicated to railway undertakings by other appropriate means.

NetRelation explicitly models these connections by linking two linear elements (elementA and elementB) and defining their physical or logical relationship.
Net relations also specify the permitted directions of travel:
•	AB: Trains can move from element A to element B.
•	BA: Trains can move from element B to element A.
•	Both: Movement is bidirectional.
•	None: No movement is allowed between the two elements.
To make this even more precise, net relations include information about whether the connection is at the origin of each element. For example, a relation might indicate that Track A ends at its origin (offset 0) and connects to Track B at its start (isOnOriginOfElementA and isOnOriginOfElementB).
