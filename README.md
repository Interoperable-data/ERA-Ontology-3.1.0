# About this fork (A. Magnien, UIC)
Purpose is to make progress on topology: representation of navigabilities.

The rationale was originally expressed in the SemanticRSM repository and its associated Wiki.

The version proposed in the present fork might differ, since neither SemanticRSM not ERA Ontology are frozen. Improvements, fine-tuning, etc. may appear on both sides.

# ERA Ontology version 3.1.0
This is a draft update of the RINF extension of the ERA Ontology.
It defines the entities and thier relationships within the domain of railway infrastructure.
It includes concepts such as railway lines, operational points, tracks, signals, junctions, and other various components of the railway network.

The previous version of the ERA ontology is [here](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/era-vocabulary/).

# Legal context
This version of the ontology reflects the collaborative efforts undertaken by the EU Agency for Railways within a specialized workgroup for the European Register of Infrastructure, dedicated to the multi level description of interoperable railway network, aligning and making RINF compliant to the most recent text of the [Regulation (EU) 2019/777 of 16 May 2019 amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/1694 of 10 August 2023](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02019R0777-20230928).

3. **Commit** the changes to your own branch.
4. **Push** your changes back up to your own fork.
5. Submit a [**Pull request**](https://github.com/Interoperable-data/ERA-Ontology-3.1.0/pulls) to the **dev** branch so we can review your changes.

## Validation procedure for user requests
1. Any actor can request improvements to the RINF extension of the ERA Ontology.
2. The Ontology team evaluates if the request is technically sound and its impact in the current deployment of the Ontology itself and on the RINF System.
3. ERA evaluates its impact from the business and project management point of view and ultimately approves (or not) the request. 
4. The actor who requested the improvements is informed on when the request will be attended, including an indication of the Ontology release number that will include the request.
5. The request, if approved, is implemented by the Ontology team.
