This is a draft update of the RINF extension of the ERA Ontology.
It defines the entities and their relationships within the domain of railway infrastructure.
It includes concepts such as railway lines, operational points, tracks, signals, junctions, and other various components of the railway network.

The previous version of the ERA ontology is [here](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/era-vocabulary/).

3. ERA evaluates its impact from the business and project management point of view and ultimately approves (or not) the request. 
4. The actor who requested the improvements is informed on when the request will be attended, including an indication of the Ontology release number that will include the request.
5. The request, if approved, is implemented by the Ontology team.
